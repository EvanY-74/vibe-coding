## What did you build?
I built 3 separate projects. First, I tried to make a game with combat, however, the AI could not figure out what was wrong. Then, I tried to make a simulation of life where cells interacted with each other. Finally, I tried to make snake game but with triangles.
## What language(s) or tools did you use?
I used ChatGPT to code JavaScript application.
## Which AI tools did you use, and how?
I used ChatGPT by asking it to write the code and add various features.
## What did you do versus what AI helped with?
I tested the code and fixed adjusted parameters and settings while the AI actually wrote all the code.
## What’s one thing you’re proud of?
I am proud that I can quickly setup a project with stuff like canvas, classes, game loop logic etc. AI makes starting a new project easy as it can do a lot of boiler plate code.
## What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
I would have written one of the applications on my own. I don't know if it is me or the AI, but I can't seem to make anything significant with the AI before it broke. I tried 3 different projects and they all eventually got to a point where ChatGPT couldn't fix them.
