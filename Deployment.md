# Deployment Document for Snake Game with Triangles

## 1. Project Overview
The Snake Game with Triangles is a browser-based game where a snake moves on a 2D grid, eats food (represented by triangles), and grows in length. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself. The game is developed using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the game, including the `<canvas>` element for rendering.
- **CSS3**: Used to style the page and center the canvas.
- **JavaScript**: Implements game logic, including movement, collision detection, and score tracking.

## 3. Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) with JavaScript enabled.
- No external libraries are required for this project.

## 4. Setup Instructions
To run the game locally or on a web server, follow these steps:

1. **Download the project files**:
   - Download or clone the repository containing the `index.html` file.

2. **Open the HTML file**:
   - Navigate to the folder containing the `index.html` file.
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

3. **Web Server (Optional)**:
   - If you wish to deploy the game on a live website, upload the `index.html` file to your server’s root directory or use a simple web server to serve the file.

## 5. Game Controls
- Use the arrow keys (`Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down`) to change the direction of the snake.

## 6. Game Features
- **Canvas Rendering**: The game uses a `<canvas>` element for rendering the game state.
- **Triangle-based Snake and Food**: The snake and food are represented by triangles.
- **Collision Detection**: The game checks for both wall collisions and self-collisions.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases as the snake eats food, displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.

## 7. Deployment on a Web Server
If deploying on a web server:
1. Upload the `index.html` file to your server.
2. Ensure the server has HTTPS enabled (recommended for security).
3. Optionally, set up a domain name and point it to the server hosting the game.

## 8. Troubleshooting
- **Game not loading**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser and there are no JavaScript errors in the browser’s console.
- **Collision issues**: Review the `checkCollision` function for accurate boundary checks or self-collision logic.
- **Performance issues**: If the game runs too slowly, ensure that the `setTimeout` delay is appropriate (currently set to 100ms for a smooth gameplay experience).

## 9. Customization
- Modify the game’s canvas size by adjusting the `width` and `height` attributes of the `<canvas>` element in the HTML.
- Adjust the snake’s movement speed by changing the `setTimeout` delay in the `gameLoop()` function.
